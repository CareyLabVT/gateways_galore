# Datalogger setup

As mentioned in the [README](/README.md) file, the current ecosystem uses Campbell Scientific dataloggers. There are a number of datalogger models used in the field, such as the CR6 and CR3000 models. Dataloggers are expensive and budgets are limited, so we purchased a pre-owned [CR1000 datalogger](https://www.campbellsci.com/cr1000) from eBay for lab testing. It is an older model that is now retired, meaning it is not officially supported and is not available for sale. Despite this, there are numerous forum posts, videos, etc. available online if you need hardware or software support. You can also [call the Campbell Scientific technical support line](https://www.campbellsci.com/contact) and see if they are able to assist with hardware or software issues. Although it is not officially supported, the staff is incredibly knowledgeable and would more than likely be glad to help.
