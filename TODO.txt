- test gateway and node communication 

DOCUMENTATION:
- organize for node, gateway, and datalogger
- add hardware photos
- rewrite as .md file
- add gw_receiver3.py to /gateway/

GATEWAY:
- put together hardware
- setup wireguard for remote access
- setup systemd unit file for gw_receiver3.py
- handle out-of-order and repeated packets from node
- handle receiving multiple nodes at once, multithreading?
- CRC error handling(?)
- handle CSV-reconstitution better:
	- name files based on device name rather than devEUI
	- append instead of adding new file per-session

NODE:
- improve ADR bump-ups
- make state machine clearer and more concise
- CRC error handling(?)
- temperature reading instead of random values
- increase time between wake-ups

DATALOGGER:
- chunk data instead of row-by-row
-
